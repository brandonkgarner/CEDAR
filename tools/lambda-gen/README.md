# (Lambda GENERATOR)  TOOLS



### microMolder:

**microMolder** will look at the triggers/bindings ["api","s3","cloudwatch"] provided in a given configuration to "find" and "define" basic **Ansible** requirements needed to deploy lambdas into other Environments/Accounts.

microMolder [microMolder.py] builds environment definitions needed for Ansible to deploy to target environments. requirements are :

 * boto3
 * Requires configuration file **[ENVR.yaml]** to match each env credentials.
 * params are:
    *  **Lambda target** (the name of the lambda to deploy
    *  **role-name** used to switch into for each environment
    *  **configuration file** , same dir as microMolder.py
    *  **Origin Account Number** of source used for creating Ansible definitions
    *  **Path of final location** to copy final, Ansible, Role structure 
    *  **API-TREE** LABEL target to not copy all related API's. (if *null* , string, is passed Multiple TREE (resources) are defined)
    *  **isFullUpdate** copies existing directory to <name>_old and re-generates **ENTIRE** structure this is much slower!!! 
 * pass in null for role-name, API-TREE and Path if not needed

Trust for Role must look like (note both api and lambda included):
```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "apigateway.amazonaws.com",
          "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```


#### Ansible Execution:

 * once above ROLE is complete simple ansible call will work like:
    *  **ansible-playbook -i windows-servers CR-Admin-Users.yml -vvvv**
